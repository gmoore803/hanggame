# Hangman Game 
### Written for amusement and fun.



My hangman game is very simple game that accepts user input and projects output. The process to make the game is very simple and involves very low level use of coding but still complex in its own. The word bank uses close to 400 words to choose from. 

# ***How To Play**

-To play the game all you need to do is guess a letter. 
-When you guess a letter right it enters that in the word bank. 
-When you answer a letter wrong it adds a line to hangman. 
-If you can guess the word before it fills out the hangman then you win.
